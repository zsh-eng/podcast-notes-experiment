# Podcast Notes Experiments

Experiments before building the podcast notes app.

Design is not important, just to explore the functionality and get a basic
understanding of how to build the actual mobile app.

## Tasks

- [ ] Understand podcast RSS feed structure
- [ ] Create data schema
- [ ] Display single podcast + episodes
- [ ] Download podcast episodes (IndexedDB for storage)
- [ ] Download and cache all assets (e.g. album art)
- [ ] Show download progress (HTTP range headers?)
- [ ] Podcast playback
- [ ] Podcast note (associated with timestamp)

- [ ] Go through Expo tutorial
- [ ] Rebuild in React Native
- [ ] Understand playback, media track API
- [ ] Storage APIs on mobile, drizzle expo sqlite
- [ ] Using emulator for dev, creating release build locally

Additional features (essential, but not for MVP)

- [ ] Transcription with Whisper (handling specific audio chunks?)
- [ ] Gemini Flash to identify sponsored segments
- [ ] Add RSS feed for more podcasts (slide up kind of UI)
- [ ] Highlights / quotations of the transcript associated with note
- [ ] UI similar to libby
- [ ] Export notes to markdown / obsidian
