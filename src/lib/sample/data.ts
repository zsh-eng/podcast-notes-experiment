      'Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation on something that matters. How do we address climate change if the political system fails to act? Has the logic of markets infiltrated too many aspects of our lives? What is the future of the Republican Party? What do psychedelics teach us about consciousness? What does sci-fi understand about our present that we miss? Can our food system be just to humans and animals alike?\n\nUnlock full access to New York Times podcasts and explore everything from politics to pop culture.

      description:
        '<p>Artificial general intelligence — an A.I. system that can beat humans at almost any cognitive task — is arriving in just a couple of years. That’s what people tell me — people who work in A.I. labs, researchers who follow their work, former White House officials. A lot of these people have been calling me over the last couple of months trying to convey the urgency. This is coming during President Trump’s term, they tell me. We’re not ready.</p><p>One of the people who reached out to me was Ben Buchanan, the top adviser on A.I. in the Biden White House. And I thought it would be interesting to have him on the show for a couple reasons: He’s not connected to an A.I. lab, and he was at the nerve center of policymaking on A.I. for years. So what does he see coming? What keeps him up at night? And what does he think the Trump administration needs to do to get ready for the AGI — or something like AGI — he believes is right on the horizon?</p><p><i><strong>This episode contains strong language.</strong></i></p><p>Mentioned:</p><p>“<a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace" target="_blank">Machines of Loving Grace</a>” by Dario Amodei</p><p>“<a href="https://www.secondbest.ca/p/ninety-five-theses-on-ai" target="_blank">Ninety-five theses on AI</a>” by Samuel Hammond</p><p>“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-george-saunders.html" target="_blank">What It Means to be Kind in a Cruel World</a>” by The Ezra Klein Show with George Saunders</p><p>Book recommendations:</p><p><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo13179781.html" target="_blank">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a> by Thomas Kuhn</p><p><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Rise-of-the-Machines/" target="_blank">Rise of the Machines</a> by Thomas Rid</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609280/a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain-by-george-saunders/" target="_blank">A Swim in a Pond in the Rain</a> by George Saunders</p><p>Thoughts?

      title: "The Dark Heart of Trump's Foreign Policy",
      description:
        '<p>If you’re looking for a single-sentence summation of the change in America’s foreign policy under Donald Trump, you could do worse than what Trump said on Wednesday:</p><p>“The European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That’s the purpose of it. And they’ve done a good job of it. But now I’m president.”</p><p>Trump seems to loathe America’s traditional European allies even as he warms relations with Russia. He’s threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico while softening his rhetoric on China. And he seems fixated on the idea of territorial expansion — whether it’s the Panama Canal, Greenland or even Gaza.   </p><p>There is a “Trump doctrine” emerging here. It’s one that could be glimpsed dimly in Trump’s first term but is exploding to the fore in his second. What will it mean for the world? What will it mean for the United States?</p><p>Fareed Zakaria is the host of CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” a columnist for The Washington Post and the author of the best-selling “Age of Revolutions.” He’s one of the clearest foreign policy thinkers around, and he doesn’t disappoint here. </p><p><i><strong>This episode contains strong language.</strong></i></p><p>Mentioned:</p><p>“<a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/rise-illiberal-democracy" target="_blank">The Rise of Illiberal Democracy</a>” by Fareed Zakaria</p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/576193/the-jungle-grows-back-by-robert-kagan/" target="_blank">The Jungle Grows Back</a> by Robert Kagan</p><p><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Diplomacy/Henry-Kissinger/9780671510992" target="_blank">Diplomacy</a> by Henry Kissinger</p><p><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Wise-Men/Walter-Isaacson/9781476728827" target="_blank">The Wise Men</a> by Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas</p><p>Thoughts?

      title: 'A Theory of Media That Explains 15 Years of Politics',
      description:
        '<p>In 2016, when Donald Trump won the first time, a little-known book became an unexpected phenomenon. It was “<a href="https://press.stripe.com/the-revolt-of-the-public" target="_blank">The Revolt of the Public</a>,” self-published two years earlier by a former C.I.A. media analyst, Martin Gurri. Gurri, who is now a visiting research fellow at the Mercatus Center, argued that a revolution in how information flowed was driving political upheavals in country after country: The dynamics of modern media ecosystems naturally created distrust toward institutions and elites, and this was fueling waves of revolt against the status quo. The problem, though, was that though these dynamics could destroy existing political systems, they could not build enduring replacements.</p><p>Gurri’s book has been on my mind over the past year. In some ways, it explains 2024 better than it explains 2016. But time didn’t just change Gurri’s book; it changed Gurri. After refusing to cast a ballot for president in 2016 and 2020, he voted for Donald Trump in 2024. And in his writing for The Free Press, The New York Post and elsewhere, he’s been arguing that Trump’s second term might herald the mastery of this new informational world and the emergence of an enduring new political system.</p><p>I found myself more convinced by Gurri’s old theory than his new one. So I asked him on the show to talk about it.</p><p><strong>(Also: </strong>If you’re interested in joining Ezra Klein on his book tour in March and April, you can see the stops and get tickets for the events here: <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/p/abundance-tour" target="_blank">https://www.simonandschuster.com/p/abundance-tour</a>)</p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href="https://human-as-media.com/the-book-postjournalism/" target="_blank">Postjournalism and the Death of Newspapers</a> by Andrey Mir.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Most-Things-Fail-Extinction/dp/0470089199" target="_blank">Why Most Things Fail</a> by Paul Ormerod</p><p><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178707/not-born-yesterday?srsltid=AfmBOoqveBP-NhWgRihBLd4TxN8YXk-Zx5dM1Hmtzpd8zQzqHlyxX6V3" target="_blank">Not Born Yesterday</a> by Hugo Mercier</p><p>Thoughts?
